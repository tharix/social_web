<h1>This project is based on Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript (with PHP 8, MySQL 8, PDO, and React) 6th Edition</h1>

<h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>

<b><p> You must have installed AMPPS before if want to run this project on your machine.
As of 2022 I no-longer recommend the AMPPS web server stack. Firstly, version 4.0 on Windows is supposed to be stable but I have found numerous issues on a number of different PCs and believe it is still not ready for full release. Furthermore, although the installer is reduced in size, you now have to install all the features you need yourself, and this can be a confusing matter. Also, I have been unable to make AMPPS work on recent MacOS computers.</p>

<p>Therefore I now recommend <a href='http://mamp.info'>MAMP</a> for both Windows and MacOS. It is quick and easy to install and works well. You should be able to set it up without too much trouble, and future editions of the book will include a walk-through to make it even easier.</p></b>

<p><i>Please note that Mac and Linux users should scroll a little down the Download page at the AMPPS website to find the Old Versions section for your download files.</i></p>

<p> All the other information you need to run, understand and modify these examples can be found in the book.</p>

<p>Once you have a web server set up, copy the entire structure of folders and subfolders into your document root directory by downloading and extracting zip from this repo, and you'll easily be able to navigate through the project by typing <i>localhost</i> into your web browser.

<p><b>Note</b>: The <i>social_web</i> folder link will issue errors when clicked unless you have previously created both a MySQL user and database called <i>robinsnest</i>, and run the <i>setup.php</i> program in this folder.</p>
